        My Dearest Muskan,

From the moment our paths crossed, my life has been brighter, filled with happiness and love that I never knew existed. There is something incredibly special about you—your kindness, your beauty, and the way you bring warmth to everything around you. Every smile you share, every word you speak, every moment spent with you has made me realize just how precious you are.

Muskan, Ive come to understand that love isn't just a feeling; its an adventure, one that I want to embark on with you by my side. Every thought of the future fills me with excitement because I can’t imagine it without you in it. I want to be there for you, to support you through everything life has in store, to share every joy and overcome every challenge hand in hand.

Today, with all the love in my heart, I want to ask you something that feels like the most natural step for me:

Will you be mine? Will you make me the happiest person alive by being with me, not just today, but forever?

No matter what comes, I promise to always cherish, respect, and love you with all that I have. Im ready for this journey with you, and I hope you feel the same.

With all my love,
[I LOVE YOU MUSKAN JEE]
